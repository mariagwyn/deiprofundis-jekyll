<p>I am reading <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/17-9780385480017-1" target="_blank">Anne Lamott’s book, <em>Bird by Bird</em></a> in which she cites <a href="http://www.philliplopate.com/" target="_blank" >Phillip Lopate’s</a> poem as an example of shaping one’s paranoia “into something artistic and true.”  I chuckled.  In that sort of painful and true kind of way.</p>
<p><em>We who are<br />
your closest friends<br />
feel the time<br />
has come to tell you<br />
that every Thursday<br />
we have been meeting,<br />
as a group,<br />
to devise ways<br />
to keep you<br />
in perpetual uncertainty<br />
frustration<br />
discontent and<br />
torture<br />
by neither loving you<br />
as much as you want<br />
nor cutting you adrift.<br />
Your analyst is<br />
in on it,<br />
plus your boyfriend<br />
and your ex-husband;<br />
and we have pledged<br />
to disappoint you<br />
as long as you need us.<br />
In announcing our<br />association<br />
we realize we have<br />
placed in your hands<br />
a possible antidote<br />
against uncertainty<br />
indeed against ourselves.<br />
But since our Thursday nights<br />
have brought us <br />
to a community<br />
of purpose<br />
rare in itself<br />
with you as<br />
the natural center,<br />
we feel hopeful you<br />
will continue to make unreasonable<br />
demands for affection<br />
if not as a consequence<br />
of your disastrous personality<br />
then for the good of the collective.</em></p>
