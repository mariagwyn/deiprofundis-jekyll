<em>In Communion</em> recently published a wonderful article by Dr. Demetra Velisarios  on women in the church.  Here is a snippet, but the whole article is well stated and should be read by all concerned!
[quote=Demetra Jaquet]The walls which most need to be pointed out between men and women are primarily the walls of fear, defensiveness and ego which we have built around ourselves, causing us to harm others on a sliding scale from occasional minor offenses to extreme and chronic paralyzing abuse. From behind those walls emanate arrows of accusation, domination and forced submission which are an affront to God and to Godâ€™s spirit and action within us.[/quote]
