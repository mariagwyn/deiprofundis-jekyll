I can't take credit for finding "<a href="http://www.ourfuture.org/blog-entry/mythbusting-canadian-health-care-part-i" target="_blank">Mythbusting Canadian Health Care -- Part I</a>", but I think it is a MUST READ.  I am looking foward to Part II.  It was first brought to my attention on <a href="http://postsfromportland.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Elizabeth's blog</a>, who found it on her friend <a href="http://monicaklepac.blogspot.com/2008/02/collective-responsibility.html" target="_blank">Monica's blog</a>.  I have always been frustrated by the &quot;but-socialized-healthcare-would-be-awful-after-all-look-at-Canada&quot; argument, especially since I have never met a SINGLE Canadian who says this, or who would trade their social benefits for all those lovely things I get as a citizen of this grand and powerful nation.  The best quote (well, one of many worthy quotables, but which explains my choice of title):

[quote=Sara Robinson]
The philosophical basis of America's privatized health care system might best be characterized as medical Calvinism. It's fascinating to watch well-educated secularists who recoil at the Protestant obsession with personal virtue, prosperity as a cardinal sign of election by God, and total responsibility for one's own salvation turn into fire-eyed, moralizing True Believers when it comes to the subject of Taking Responsibility For One's Own Health.[/quote]

And finally, a useful link to Fresh Air's interview of our current <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18910326" target="_blank">Candidate' Prescriptions</a>.
