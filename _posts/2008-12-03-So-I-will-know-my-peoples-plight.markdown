<p>Show me the suffering of the most miserable;<br />
So I will know my people's plight.<br />
Free me to pray for others;<br />
For you are present in every person.<br />
Help me take responsibility for my own life;<br />
So that I can be free at last.<br />
Grant me courage to serve others;<br />
For in service there is true life.<br />
Give me honesty and patience;<br />
So that the Spirit will be alive among us.<br />
Let the Spirit flourish and grow;<br />
So that we will never tire of the struggle.<br />
Let us remember those who have died for justice;<br />
For they have given us life.<br />
Help us love even those who hate us;<br />
So we can change the world.<br />
â€”Cesar Chavez</p>
