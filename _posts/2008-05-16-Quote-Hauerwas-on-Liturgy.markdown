<p>Sometimes, you just have to toss something out there and see what happens. There is no ethicist better at this than Stanley Hauerwas. And if he is right, then, well, we should pay attention to our liturgy, yes?</p>
<blockquote><p>One reason why we Christians argue so much about which hymn to sing, which liturgy to follow, which way to worship is that the commandments teach us to believe that bad liturgy eventually leads to bad ethics. You begin by singing some sappy, sentimental hymn, then you pray some pointless prayer, and the next thing you know you have murdered your best friend.</p>
