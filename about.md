This blog is all about questions. Questions about our life in and from God, the practices that form or misform that life, the theology and ethical perspectives that undergird, or destroy, such a life. This is a forum for engaging discussion and constructive critique.

## About the name "Dei Profundis"
"De Profundis" is the Latin opening to <a href="http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=70813836" target="_blank" title="Psalm 130 - NRSV">Psalm 130</a>, "Out of the depths I cry to you Oh Lord," an oft repeated Lenten refrain. "Dei" is Latin for "of God." So, "deiprofundis" is a neologism that translates to something like "out of the depths of God" or "out of God from the depths," or whatever spin you want to give it. I considered "Εκ Βαθεον" but we in the West don't do so well with Greek. And alas, "deprofundis" was taken, by the Hungarian T-Mobile and a WOW Guild. Now, it is a Hungarian NGO. Go figure.
