old about

I live in Portland, Oregon, my preferred location after living in Los Angeles, Iowa, Los Angeles, and Boston. In that order. I have an enduring love for tall pine trees, drizzle, and flowers in March. I am joyfully married to Elizabeth, who I met in the land of dripping evergreen and flowering spring. I have designed <a href="http://drupal.org/">drupal</a> web-sites off and on for years, and spent almost 9 years working for <a href="http://acquia.com/">Acquia</a> managing change processes, support teams, and coders.</p>
<p>However, on of my by greatest loves has always been the fraught life of the Christian Church (or 'churches', that is its own theological debate). In addition to an M.Div from <a href="http://fuller.edu/" target="_blank">Fuller Seminary</a>, I have a Ph.D in theology and ethics from <a href="http://bc.edu/" target="_blank">Boston College</a>. I defended my dissertation in 2010, "The Joy of Enacted Virtue: Toward the Ordination of Women to the Eastern Orthodox Priesthood." In case it is not clear from the postings on this site, I am an advocate of constructive arguments <em>for </em>the full participation of women, 'the gays', and generally non-cis-gender-conforming persons in the life of the Church (or 'churches', see above).

In the interest of full disclosure, and for the benefit of all who like to know what box in which to put me, I am quite progressive in my politics with some surprisingly traditional theological views. I adore doctrine, though some may find my definition of it less rule-bound than that word currently signifies to many. I am a white North-American woman, a feminist and a student of liberation theologies. Until I was excommunicated for marrying my wife, I was a cradle-member (read: baptized as a tiny-weeny child) of the <a href="http://orthodoxwiki.org/Main_Page" target="_blank" title="OrthodoxWiki">Eastern Orthodox Church</a><a href="http://www.oca.org/" target="_blank" title="Orthodox Church in America">OCA</a>, then <a href="http://antiochian.org/" target="_blank" title="Antiochian Archdiocese of America">AOA</a>, and then the <a href="http://www.goarch.org/" target="_blank" title="Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America">GOA</a>), and considered myself a North-American Orthodox.  Whatever that is.  I am it.  I have also taken forays into evangelical Christianity (via <a href="http://intervarsity.org/" target="_blank" title="InterVarsity">IVCF</a> and <a href="http://www.fuller.edu/" target="_blank" title="Fuller Theological Seminary">Fuller Seminary</a>). I am now a grateful communicant in <a href="http://www.episcopalchurch.org/" target="_blank">The Episcopal Church</a> and was ordained to the priesthood in 2017. I would say that I am an Orthodox Anglican, or an Anglican Orthodox, but neither of those communions will have me. C'est la ekklesia!

If all those things seem oddly juxtaposed, well, they are and maybe one of these days I will blog my bio in more detail. I am not sure I listed compatible boxes, but best of luck in your attempts!
